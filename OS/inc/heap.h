 * @brief Implements memory heap for dynamic memory allocation.
 * Follows standard malloc/calloc/realloc/free interface
 * for allocating/unallocating memory.
 * modified 8/31/08 Jonathan Valvano for style
 * modified 12/16/11 Jonathan Valvano for 32-bit machine
 * modified August 10, 2014 for C99 syntax
 * This example accompanies the book
 * "Embedded Systems: Real Time Operating Systems for ARM Cortex M Microcontrollers",
 * ISBN: 978-1466468863, Jonathan Valvano, copyright (c) 2014
 * Implementation Notes:
 * This is a Knuth Heap. Each block has a header and a trailer, which I shall
 * call the meta-sections.  The meta-sections are each a single int32_t that tells
 * how many int32_ts/words can be stored between the header and trailer.
 * If the block is used, the meta-sections record the room as a positive
 * number.  If the block is unused, the meta-sections record the room as a
 * negative number.
